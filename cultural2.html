			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In the information society we're facing right now, as the technology progresses, I believe that everyone would agree to the idea that the advancement of technology had bring us lots of benefits and advantages. In variety ways, our life had turned out to be more convenient than before. However, by being such an irreplaceable existence, the innovation of technology, especially in the use of cell phones, is also getting our focus of life off track, which we didn't recognize, in the meanwhile. According to a survey based on mobile phones, David Nagel, a reporter of the journal states that most elementary and secondary students are using mobile devices in their studies, either in the classroom or at home. And, according to a new study, the majority would like to be able to use them more in class. (David Nagel, "the journal"). Teenagers today spend a large portion of their time on scrolling their phones, and the effect that this situation caused had gone far beyond than we imagined. By spending so much time on a certain technology in our daily life, there are already many cases that show its shocking effect on us. Students could be distracted during classes, our health might be harmed and causing serious diseases, and moreover, we start to forget the importance of the direct communication between people.</p>
