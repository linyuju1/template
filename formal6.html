			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>People’s endeavors of undertaking a perfect research are impossible. It is improbable to realize a perfect research owing to its ceaseless nature. The key purpose of commencing on any study is to induct veiled facts for a projected purpose. The disproportions in indulgences instigated by persona differences are the key causes behind the mottled deviations of research. It is noteworthy to establish that research entails several categories. The significant purpose of beginning on any exploration is to inaugurate indirect facts for a planned purpose. Any research integrates the distinct personalities of a researcher who has to induct answers and surmise a corollary. It is improbable of conducting a faultless research since each cluster of research entrances its discrete limitations. This result prompts different researchers to form different verifications by employing varied structures of research.</p>
	    <p>New facts, inventions and re-invention are all possible results of any given research. Isaac Newton defined the law of universal gravitation with reference to Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. His lack of appreciation of Heliocentrism and his contrasting ideas led him to the discovery of gravity.  Given the unembellished meaning of research (to search again), research is a continuous process of improvement, dismissal or appraisal of facts, theories and laws that have been advanced prior. It is therefore deductible that no single research is adherent to the rule of authenticity presented with the definition of research. Every research problem must have a source (Exell, 12). Research is borne by the researcher’s environment, encounters, previous research findings, state of mind, background et cetera. The researcher’s creativity notwithstanding, societal, psychological and occupational factors also come into play. </p>
	    <p>Research can never be complete. Every researcher’s conclusion is open to discussion and testing by him/her and other researchers. Over time, theories and laws are put to the test. Some are revised while others are disregarded. Partial acceptance and partial severance of theories and laws is common too. Provided the earth continues to revolve, change is the only constant factor known to man and as such, research is open to varying results in varying times and environments. No researcher’s conclusion is final (Mehra, 15). </p>
	    <p>There is of course a crossover with new media technologies and traditional media forms, such as the internet and newspapers. Over the years, newspapers have been struggling, due to the constantly developing technology of the internet, with it being easier for people to log onto the internet to read news, as opposed to walking to their local shop to buy a newspaper. This instant access to everything that the internet both allows and is known for makes it difficult for any other media form to compete with it. As a result, there are few newspapers in the United Kingdom that do not now have a website, meaning traditional media forms are making use of the new technologies available to ensure they continue to provide what their readers want  – offering news to their readers at the exact time they want access to it, and through the medium they most prefer to access it through.</p>
