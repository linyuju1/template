			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>To illustrate, ten years ago dial-up broadband was a new advancement in technology, allowing people to log onto the internet from the comfort of their own homes. However, just a few years later we have broadband where there is no need to dial up in order to access the connection, through wires. We have also seen a further advancement in the capabilities of the internet with Wi-Fi becoming a feature of most cafes and restaurants, allowing people to connect to others online. With society witnessing such life-altering advancements over just the past few years, as well as the internet’s increasingly important role within the media and globalization as a whole, it may be that future media forms simply cannot offer anything above and beyond what the internet can.</p>
			<p>It has also been suggested that social implications in relation to traditional media have arisen, as a result of the introduction of the internet. According to Grieco and Holmes (99), ‘many observers allege that the internet is changing society’, and this is backed up by a recent survey conducted by Gartner Inc. analysts. They found that ‘newspapers are faced with declining circulations, falling offline and online revenue, and failing to capitalize on their biggest supporters, their readers, as a result of competition from digital sources’ (Dingra 10).Now, with the technology we have, coupled with the number of professionals delivering high quality services, new media forms such as the internet is providing an immediate, informative, intelligent, interactive platform, which is the perfect place for discussion and debate to take place.</p>
			<p>Additionally, a report by McCann Universal McCann’s report particularly looked into the impact of social media, comparing it to traditional media forms. The report found that online media such as blogs, social networks, and online videos are accessed by around 17,000 everyday, with social media being a global phenomenon (Dingra 12).</p>
			<p>With it being suggested that today there are over 2 billion computers connected to the internet on a daily basis (We Media 3), this is just one-tenth of the world’s population, making the internet a medium that has the opportunity to become even more powerful and playing an even more important role in time to come. The internet is the latest media technology, resulting in the evolution of the internet in a global information infrastructure. Together, the introduction of the internet, along with globalization ‘signify sweeping social cultural and institutional change, with the end results defining our age’ (Ward  137). Further, Ward observes that the internet has been hailed as a new engine of history, ‘transforming our sense of time, place and community, while also giving way to a new society’ (140). Like other media technologies, the internet has provided room for disputes and disagreements, in the way of the London riots, for example, when groups involving hundreds of people were able to plan disastrous events, unbeknown to the Police. Similarly, the internet has also been ‘widely used by rebels in countries such as Mexico, Russia, and Nigeria, where activists used the internet to plan events on a global scale,’ as Ward asserts (141). The internet is a popular media form to use in situations like these, due to people being contactable instantly, with it taking just seconds to set up an event on either a local or global scale.</p>
			<p>The disparities in understandings instigated by personality differences are the main motives behind the varied divergences of research. Scholars take on researches chiefly since they aspire to endorse that their philosophies are perfect. This continues to be the motivation behind incessant studies on comparable subjects in research. The system of executing a research impinges on the outset that any prior knowledge on a definite focus is imperfect even if it is comprehensive (Zeffiro 188). Succeeding researches encompass the purpose of perfecting prior discoveries and judgments. Flick (24) proposes that each research undertaken has a predisposition on previous analysis and will prevail even to forthcoming researches.
The key intention of initiating any investigation is to inaugurate secreted facts for an envisioned purpose. This declaration objectifies the datum that an analysis has to encompass sensible inferences that vary with the original conviction. This signifies after concluding any research, no ensuing investigations on the issue should follow whatsoever. On conditions that there is an ensuing research, it follows that the preceding study was defective. A research incorporates the discrete personalities of a researcher who has to inaugurate answers and infer a corollary (Locke et al 113). No individual is impeccable and no exploration undertaken by any person is immaculate. A single researcher might conclude definite discoveries and inferences on a definite matter while an ensuing scholar might obtain opposing discernments on the topic.</p>
