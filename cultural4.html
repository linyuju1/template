			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>"Facebook. Twitter, secondLife. “Smart” phones, robotic pets." (Sherry Turkle, "Alone Together"). This is what Sherry Turkle, a Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology of MIT, says in her interview about Alone together, her latest book that illustrates how the change in technology can affect and harm relationships among us. Agreeing to what she said, we're getting to know each other more through social networking and technology on the surface, but we're ignoring the importance of face-to-face interactions internally. By being a teenager myself, I've been in the situations many times that Sherry suggests; cell phones alienate us even when we are not alone. Once again, I have the same opinion to the point that Smartphones bring conveniences under circumstances when I'm apart with my friends. Whenever we want to meet up, a simple call or text or applications that allow us to chat could help us solve the problem easily. However, when we scheduled our time to meet with each other, we forget the most important point that we're not taking opportunities to spend time with our laptops or phones together with someone, we were asking to communicate with people. By bringing conveniences, Smartphones took place of our social skills. We text and email to those who are far away from us but not paying attention to those who are right next to us. Why we are expecting more from technology, she says, but less from each other? (Sherry Turkle, "Alone Together") Furthermore, another research on the University Herald points out that University students on average check their phones 11 times per day while in class, and more than 80 percent have reported that this tech fascination affects their learning and a fourth of the respondents have admitted their grade have suffered as a result. (Stephen Adkins, "University Herald"). By having such a thing that can be used to do in-class research, to take notes, and to set reminders for assignments, teachers believe that students wouldn't lose chances to use it for different purposes. In fact, students didn’t feel that texting caused serious problems in the classroom. (Maryellen Weimer, "Teaching and Learning, strategies for teaching face-to-face and online.") Many of them state that they did understand that the person texting is being distracted and maybe distracts a few students sitting nearby, but they were reluctant to support a policy that forbids the use of cell phones. In my opinion however, from a student's perspective, I stand on the side where I believe that education is expensive and anyone paying for it should be entitled to a distraction-free environment. (Jolene, "timesunion"). But to ban them completely so that students aren’t distracted by email/Facebook/whatever is a futile effort. It is us students have to refrain from our addiction to phones. If a student isn’t engaged, they’re going to distract themselves in other ways. It's the person matters, not the tool.</p>
