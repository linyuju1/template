	</main>	"Technology alienates us from others," this is what Sherry Turkle, a Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology, believes in her book, "Alone together." In the information society we're facing right now, as the technology progresses, we people start to ignore the importance of face-to-face interactions. Although many researches lead to the result that technology started to take place of human communications; By looking at the good side, however, it is also true that technology isn't just a destruction among human relationships, but also a symbolism of our culture advancement. And moreover, to me, it is also something that helps to shape my career path.
		Communication, a field of study discussing about how information can be conveyed through exchanging of thoughts, messages, or information, is the major I'm planning to apply for. Before I started to become acquainted with this major, communication was only the varieties of how we can talk to people in my own definition. I understood that it is a channel of negotiation no matter between our friends, family, or anyone else. However, I never thought that communication could be either intentional or unintentional, conventional or unconventional signals, and furthermore, in verbal or nonverbal forms. Although people might say that comparing to communication, major in finance or business would create a better path for my career and my future life. But when I was in high school choosing my major, I didn't want to be one of those who decide their majors only because their parents said so, or those who didn't know what they are keen for but knowing that they should pick something that has a better way out. I didn't want to sit in the office all day counting numbers, all I wanted to do is to work on the things I love every day. By holding on to such a dream though, I didn't know what I had obsessions for. And it wasn't until an incident happened at my age of 12, lead me onto this track.
		Although my home country, Taiwan, is only a small island located at the southeast part of China, it is well known of its prosperity of news information especially in television broadcasting. In 1962, the first television station TTV, Taiwan Television, started to operate in Taiwan. During that time, there was only 4 channels broadcasting and repeating on the TVs. However, when it comes to our century, the cable television had already ascend over hundred channels. Throwback to 2006, when I was still a primary student, our family was living at the capital of Taiwan, Taipei, while my brother was living alone at the northern part of Taiwan. At that point, the utilization of smart phones wasn't that prevalent yet, and the operation of Skype didn't come into vogue neither. One day when me and my mom were resting at home while listening to the radio as usual, we overheard that a building in the city where my brother was living was on a huge fire, and we soon got to realize that it was my brother's apartment. We were all in a panic. My mom picked up the phone immediately and tried to reach my brother, but we just couldn't. We turned on the TV trying to see if there was any latest news, and all we could see was people gathering downstairs of the building, fire trucks whistling and reporters trying to get the newest information. That was the first time I get to know the existence of SNG cars, satellite news gathering. And it wasn't until the SNG cars made a live on-the-spot we get to know that my brother was safe and no one was injured during that fire. After that occasion, my dream to be a news anchor to study in the region of broadcasting sparked. I wish to be like them to report the newest emergencies, broadcast the latest updates, and inform the most recent events. It was the advancement of media information inspired me. It was this technology developing every day motivated me to become one of them. To become the one who has the firsthand data and would hurry to the spot just to spread the information out to the world. When I was 12, it was this piece of technology eased our family's worries and helped us through our situation; and right now, 7 years later, it is this same piece of technology again lead me to my chosen field. 
		As soon as I stepped into this area, I realized that communications are not only media studies but also social science. No matter it is verbal or nonverbal, even your body language and choice tonality play a significant role. Imagine you're watching someone's presentation, the presenter reads her press release monotonically and without smiling, stands like a penguin and without gestures. Would that attract your attention and convince you to buy her story? Last semester, I got a chance to take the course COM 100, which is a class that helps you to practice your ability of public speaking. In order to accomplish my dream, I thought, it is the first step for me to actually talk in public, especially when I'm going to face my audience in the camera in the future, I would want to look good and be able to speak confidently and fluently without pauses. "Actions speak louder than words," this is what we had been told throughout the whole semester. The contents of what we are talking is absolutely significant, but in the mean while, during our presentation, the most important visual is not those resplendent PowerPoint slide overflowing with data, it is us. By making eye contacts, we don't stare or look blankly into people's eyes but we show facial expressions that are natural and friendly; By attracting people's attention, we don't sway back and forth like a pendulum but we use the physical space we have available and walk it to emphasize our points. There was once when we were giving our informative speech and the TAs were using their cameras to record our appearance. Different than before, we had to look into the camera, and to be honest, it was tough for me. It wasn't until I replayed the video afterwards and I realized that by trying to look in a more professional way, my informative speech turned out to be a persuasive one. My smiles were gone, my eyes were scrolling, and I was talking like a robot. Once again, it was this technology helped me to make a step out and improve myself to make my way forward.
		As the times progresses, the universality of the study of communication already becomes irreplaceable and inimitable. Without the satellite cars and those anchors at the live, me and my family would lost our track to my brother and be in deeply worried and anxious. Before I get to learn about this major and look into the history of news reporting, I never thought that my experience dealing with technology would made such a big impact on me during the point in time. Communication is not only the study of journalism, advertising, or public relation. It is the reflection of human interactions. It is around us every where just like technology.
