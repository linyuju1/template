	</main>	"Technology alienates us from others," this is what Sherry Turkle, a Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology, believes in her book, "Alone together." In the information society we're facing right now, as the technology progresses, we people start to ignore the importance of face-to-face interactions. Although many researches lead to the result that technology started to take place of human communications; By looking at the good side, however, it is also true that technology isn't just a destruction among human relationships, but also a symbolism of our culture advancement. And moreover, to me, it is also something that helps to shape my career path.
		Communication, a field of study discussing about how information can be conveyed through exchanging of thoughts, messages, or information, is the major I'm planning to apply for. Before I started to become acquainted with this major, communication was only the varieties of how we can talk to people in my own definition. I understood that it is a channel of negotiation no matter between our friends, family, or anyone else. However, I never thought that communication could be either intentional or unintentional, conventional or unconventional signals, and furthermore, in verbal or nonverbal forms. Although people might say that comparing to communication, major in finance or business would create a better path for my career and my future life. But when I was in high school choosing my major, I didn't want to be one of those who decide their majors only because their parents said so, or those who didn't know what they are keen for but knowing that they should pick something that has a better way out. I didn't want to sit in the office all day counting numbers, all I wanted to do is to work on the things I love every day. By holding on to such a dream though, I didn't know what I had obsessions for. And it wasn't until an incident happened at my age of 12, lead me onto this track.
