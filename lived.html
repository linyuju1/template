	</main>	"Technology alienates us from others," this is what Sherry Turkle, a Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology, believes in her book, "Alone together."

Although many researches lead to the result that technology started to take place of human communications; By looking at the good side, however, it is also true that technology isn't just a destruction among human relationships, but also a symbolism of our culture advancement. And moreover, to me, it is also something that helps to shape my career path.
