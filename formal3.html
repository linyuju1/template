			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Mass media comprises various forms of communication, with the susceptibility to address and reach a large audience, inclusive of television, radio, magazines, books, newspapers, billboards, recordings, and the internet. Research is both an investigative and confirmative evaluation of a hypothesis or hypotheses (Exell 12). One cannot claim to be conducting a research if they do not formulate a hypothesis to point at the specific or general question the research seeks to answer. Research may take two forms:  qualitative and quantitative.  Qualitative or quantitative research can take quasi-experimental, comparative, case study, historical and developmental analysis.  A researcher is therefore required to focus his/her energies in comparison, differentiation, review, appraisal, judgement, advancement and evaluation of research conducted prior by fellow researchers. Globalization is a ‘vague term used by academics, policymakers, politicians and journalists, linked to a global means of communication that has no boundaries’ (Ward 94).With the term used over 30 years ago to describe how media technologies were breaking down the communication barriers of many countries, globalization is a term that still has the same meaning today.</p>
		  <p>Joseph Dominic and compatriot Roger Wimmer support the proposal that research and statistics are two diverse fields in terms of methods and results. Researchers, as opposed to statisticians, undertake research. On the contrary, statisticians play a part in the research process, as they design algorithms which researchers make use in studying hypotheses and research questions. As Wimmer and Dominic assert, it is essential for researchers to acquaint themselves with what they can do with research methods, in preference to their modus operandi.</p>
		  <p> In the 20th century, a technological boom allowed for the rapid proliferation of information, drawing sociologists to the field of mass communication. The inferential audio-visual technologies, coupled with the internet, have greatly contributed to mass media gaining significant influence. Media globalization is a concept that is largely driven by the interests and needs of the developed world, as a result of developing countries simply not having access to the same technologies. Although some countries play a more prominent role in the global scene than others, such as technology in America advancing quicker than that in India, media industries from a number of different countries all over the world are heavily involved in globalization. With such a large number of countries involved in the globalization of the media, there are a number of different media forms involved too, as those residents in the poorest parts of India rely on a different type of media to those who live in the richest parts of America, for example. What works in one country, does not necessarily work, or suit, another country. ‘In developing countries where the internet cannot be accessed, this is when the more traditional forms of media play a crucial role instead’ (Ward 98). According to the US bureau of labor Statistics, 2001 was the first year where the average spending by consumer units for internet success was greater than expenditure on magazines and other forms of hard copy media as shown in figure 1 below. Since then, the average spending on internet media has been growing, with spending on magazines and newspapers observing deterioration. </p>
