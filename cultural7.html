			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, while we appreciate the convenience that cell phones bring to our lives, we have to keep reminding and questioning ourselves that are we the master of Smartphones or the servant of them? While they are increasing the public connectivity since they act as our social tools, they are also decreasing our healthy social connectivity and interfering with human interaction. (n.p. "The Washington Times.") While there are times that we enjoy the new innovation and places where we share the convenience of technology, there are also times and places that we need to give each other our full attention. Undoubtedly that the progressing and advancement of technology is a good thing, but it's just that we have to put it in its place. "We live for communications with people, not with technology."</p>
