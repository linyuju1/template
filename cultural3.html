			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Based on another survey, Digital Media Test Kitchen, the research shows that the Apple iPhone was the most popular with 40% of those who reported owning a Smartphone using one of the iPhone models. Other types of Smartphones used include Blackberry with 26% and Android operating system based phones with 22%. (n.p. "Digital Media Test Kitchen."). Being the most popular Smartphone, Apple released its first Iphone on 29 June 2007 and it soon became the world's most hyped consumer product. (n.p. "The Iphone Wiki timeline). In the following year, by holding on to such a critical point, the Apple Company started its endless innovation by promoting new Iphones almost every year. Even when there was only little changes to differentiate those past Iphones, we customers would still buy their products not only because how obsessed we are to the Apple Company but also because how addicted we are to the convenience of Smartphones and we refused to go back to use a traditional one. It's our natural instincts that once we get used to the new innovation, we refuse to remember how the originalities brought us expediency in the past as well. By being an Apple fan myself too, we teenagers have been holding on to the belief that the newer is always the better, therefore, when we see the new commercials or news release saying that a new Iphone is going to debut, we blind ourselves and could only see the good things about it. Unlike cigarettes' commercials, Smartphones makers would only show the pros but not the cons about getting a Smartphone. They wouldn't remind us the harm it could cause to our hands' muscle if we over-scroll our Iphones and the damage it could cause to our eyes by staring at our Iphones on our bed with no lights on. All those Smartphone companies want isn't only to bring convenience into our life but also make profits. Nevertheless, the biggest issue is still on ourselves, the situation that we can't live without our phones.</p>
