_________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
		
		<p> 	For the multimedia remix project, our group decided to use Psy's popular song, Gangnam Style, as the social artifact to illustrate the common problem that exists in Western culture, the stereotypes that exist towards Asian culture. At the very beginning, we were struggling about how to make the video demonstrates the idea that we're trying to convey in an effective way. We wanted to create a video that could be entertaining but also educational at the same time. Therefore, instead of filming dull presentations of us emphasizing the negative impacts that stereotypes could bring us, we came with the resolution which is interviewing people, that of Asian Culture and Western Culture with their reactions towards the video we're going to show them. In addition, since we want to emphasize the giant gap between the biases towards the Asian culture, we came with the structure which is showing the video to different people of different cultures then ask related questions. Moreover, since our audience would be make up by variety of cultures, I believe there will be biases among them since this is what we're trying to convey. There will be a bias for Western cultured people that supports the western cultured participants, and vice versa for the Asian audience. The audience needs to see that the biases are there, so with that they would accept the idea from other perspectives in order to remove their biases.</p>
		<p>	The reason why we chose to make a film based on stereotypes is somehow related to the variation of cultures among our group members. When dealing with group projects, most of us had the experience of being considered as unproductive and lack of grammar skills. By carrying those biases around and suffering because of the stereotypes toward our society, we want people to feel more open minded towards our culture and us. By taking a systematic approach, we decided to interview both Western and Asian-cultured people. But to be honest, interviewing people and listening to their stereotypes of Asians could be somewhat tough and actually challenging for me. Even though people nowadays don't consider racism as a valuable custom anymore, but by realizing the fact that stereotype of Americans still prevails, it kind of affects me emotionally. No matter it is focusing on the appearance or the lack of English ability, I still believe that both of the cultures should spend more time on understanding no matter the people or the culture.</p>
		<p>	Although the process of interviewing Westerners by hearing their biases towards us can be somewhat harsh, but it also turned out to be the most beneficial resource that we used in our video. By quoting their words directly, our audience could gather information by understanding the existence of biases more easily and how it impacts the way people go about businesses and life in general. However, I found out that by interviewing Asians, it proved to be the least beneficial. Due to the fact they couldn't view the video from an "outsider's" perspective, they couldn't really see what we're trying to convey in this project. </p>
		<p>	In my opinion, I think the interaction of our group works out pretty well. We all have assigned tasks that needed to be complete before certain dates, and we all could communicate in a fairly way which everyone could share their ideas and no one would be judging. I think the biggest reason that we could finish the project on-time was the work sharing. When we encountered issues like being unable to gather at the same time, while the person who is away from us took responsibility for filming the conclusion, the rest of us stayed together to deal with film editing. It is definitely fruitful and an honor to be working in such a group. </p>
		<p>	On this project, I think every steps that we decided to take are all well-planned. And as a group member, I think I've done my responsibility as well. However, if we had more time, when it comes to editing our video, I might take more time to cut the scenes to make it runs more fluently, add subtitles to make our audience gain better understanding of what we're saying, and maybe talk more with our interviewees to value their culture like we value ours. </p>
		<p>	With Psy's bad-looking and his humorous, which both are considered as part of the stereotypes, that was created in the video helped us to make our design decision. In my perspective, the most effective aspect would be us trying to differentiate the stereotypes of Asian culture and how they actually are. Since we're trying to tell people that biases and stereotypes impact our way of life, by using Psy's music video would be helpful since it shows how stereotypes alter the way that the entertainment business functions. </p>
