			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>While there are many implications of the relationship between the internet and traditional mass media, it is clear to see that there are many advantages to the relationship too, as discussed previously. With the internet allowing open and frank communication to take place among organizations, individuals and communities, whether in the same country or overseas, people are able to interact with people they otherwise may not have been able to. The capabilities of email, instant messaging and social media websites, which are all communication tools that have been made possible by the internet, enables diverse conversation to be accessible by and for all.It will not be surprising to see more media forms available through the internet in years to come, through fear of the electronic competition. As a result, ‘it remains difficult to envision the future of traditional mass media’ (Morris 96). Previously, mass communication researchers completely overlooked the internet and its capabilities, almost disregarding it as a form of mass media, while also disregarding everything it allowed. However, today it is a very different story, with few mass communication researchers disregarding such an impressive medium (Morris 98), and a medium that much of the world’s population can have access to.</p>
			<p>Harold Lasswell, a communication theorist and political scientist, defined communication research by answering five basic questions: What is said? By whom? What channel do they use? Who is the target of the said communication debrief? What overall effects does the said communication have? In this sense, therefore, Mass communication can be defined as the transmission of a continuous flow of uniform content by professional communicators, by way of multifaceted apparatus, targeting a large, geographically discrete, and diverse audience, members of which are anonymous to the communicator, and to each other (Lasswell, and Kaplan 13). </p>
