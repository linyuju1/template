			<h2>Blog Entry #1 (In-Class Activity #1)</h2>
			<p>After watching the video that Dr. Daniels showed us today in class, I believe the purpose and the message that this video is trying to convey is to tell people how different opinions could change one’s life. In the video, the author tells us about his uncle’s story, a homosexual who eventually committed suicide because he was rejected by the society and even his own family. </p>
			<p>By narrating the story in a deep sorrow and with grieved, the author tells us that he himself is facing the same situation like his uncle. However, instead of choosing to run away from the society, the author decides to stay and face the public opinion. By telling both his own story and his uncle’s, the author illustrates the idea that how different thoughts could be applied into the same circumstance. This also helps the video to achieve its purpose since it not only exemplifies both a negative and a positive example but also contrasts the tragic story of his uncle’s to his belief that things will get better.</p>
			<p>The structure of the message starts with showing the letter that he wrote to his uncle, he then recited the letter later on. By using this structure, the author shows how he hated but also gratified that his uncle left him so that he didn’t have to take those judgments anymore. Furthermore, it also shows the impacts that his uncle had bring to him. The structure of this video turned out to be useful for us since it shows us an effective way of narrating a personal experience which we could apply into our Lived Experiences Project. </p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #2 (In-Class Activity #2)</h2>
			<p></p>
			</main> This video is targeting at those teenagers who focus on playing games so hard but make no love and have no lives. By using the example of World of Warcraft in the South Park animation, it illustrates the dilemma that teenagers think they are socializing by being in the team online chat but not actually going out and exploring the world themselves. In the game, whenever the griefer shows up, he kills everyone he meets. The griefer is depicted as a silent and obese adult, who have been playing the game nearly every hour of every day ever since the game is released, once again, someone who has no lives at all. <p></p>
Throughout the video, the boys were trying so hard to beat the griefer. They phoned the World of Warcraft support line at Blizzard Entertainment to complain about the situation, gathered all the male classmates to log in at the same time to get the griefer down but eventually failed by everyone being killed, and lastly, by listening to Cartman's suggestion, they played the game 21 hours a day to kill low-level boars to gain experiences to reach a higher level in order to attack the griefer. Although they succeeded at the end, the boys turned out to be lazy, long-haired, overweight and acne-ridden in the process.<p></p>
In my opinion, the video's creators are trying to reflect the current social issue we're facing in our real life. This is what exactly happens in our society right now. Teenagers abandon their studies and pay more attention on video games. To complete a quest or to kill someone becomes their main objective, and even when they accomplish that goal, like what Cartman says in the video, they continue to play in the same way. To be in touch with video games make the teenagers ignore the importance of their life. Their understanding of playing games had been distorted that it became "something that matters" and even took place of exercising. The video's creators are trying to change the fact of this situation and it is also what I strongly believe in.<p></p>


			<h2>Blog Entry #3 (In-Class Activity #3)</h2>
			</main> <p>The Chrysler commercial that we've been shown to features the city of Detroit and the famous rapper Eminem. This advertisement during the Super Bowl portrays Detroit in a different perspective than the opinion people have towards it, and it incorporates the purpose of it in many different ways. </p>
			<p>Firstly, although Detroit now has the reputation for its danger, this video apparently tries to tell a different story to its audience. Through the imagery of Detroit, instead of emphasizing how it was beat down and smash up, this film focus on how its past makes it into a stronger and tougher city. In the video, we can see that Chrysler 200  is passing through the great aspects of Detroit, and by showing this, we can see that Detroit has not give up yet just like the toughness of Chrysler 200. Furthermore, the inclusion of Eminem's song "Lose Yourself" is also a great tactic for advertising this video. Due to the fact the Eminem himself is from Detroit, we can see the pride he has for his home country so as the Chrysler 200 since it's originated from Detroit. Lastly, the tagline "Imported from Detroit" at the end is what makes this advertisement into an impressive one. This sentence shows how special Chrysler 200 is because it's from Detroit, the ordinary but one and only city in the United States. </p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #4</h2>
			<p>Today is our first day of class and we were introduced to the course WRA 110. To be honest, taking a writing course in my freshman year as an international student is somewhat challenging. However, I understand that in nowadays society, having the skill to read or write a good essay is essential if we want to success in upper level of education. Besides the course itself and our first assignment, we were also introduced to the website Github which we would be using it for submitting our web version of our projects. I was first very confused when Dr. Daniels taught us about how to create a template. Due to the fact that I was never in touch with computer science or the basics of HTML, it turned out to be tough and harsh for me to explore the website. I was also quite surprised by the fact that we have to know how to create a webpage on our own in a writing class. However, since it's a requirement for our assignments, we still have to figure it out or otherwise we would be taking points off for the paper we write.</p>
			<p>It didn't seem to be a difficult class as long as we accomplish what we have to do. I hope everything goes well and I can learn how to manage Github as soon as possible.</p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #5</h2>
			<p> This week we have to finish our Lived Experiences Project and submit a web version of it. To be honest, I had been dealing with my other course's homework so I wasn't on the track to work on my paper for the past few days. However, due to the horrible weather condition, Dr. Daniels was sick again and our class was cancelled. This actually benefits me because somehow I always couldn't pay attention in class to work on my papers, therefore, staying in the dorm would always be my first choice if I could since it would brings up my work efficiency. This project wasn't too hard for me since it only asked us to write about our personal experiences with an anecdote to connect to the pursuing of my current major.</p>
			<p>However, due to the fact that I always use pictures or videos instead of writing my thoughts and experience down, I realized how hard it is to put my personal experience in words especially in descriptive details. Nevertheless, by organizing my visions and goals for my future path, I get to recall my memories of the initial motivation which inspired me to choose this major. This project not only allowed us to develop our writing skills from a first person’s point of view, but also taught us how to convey information to our audience in a informal yet informative way. I actually enjoyed doing this project and it serves as a straightforward start to the course.</p>
	
	
			<h2>Blog Entry #6</h2>
			<p>We've been working on our cultural analysis from the previous weeks, and this week is the due date of our final draft. By doing this project, we needed to investigate a specific social issue and its import on society through the analysis of a cultural artifact, whether it could be a video game, movie, TV show, etc. Although it's not like the Lived Experiences Project which we could use our personal experience to build up the whole structure of our essay, but this project still allows us to use our imagination and creativity to propose a solution for the problem and the anticipated results; with a little research about the artifact and the social issue. I would still say this project is easy for me to accomplish and didn't take me too much time and efforts. However, the process of uploading our paper onto the web version was what really put me in struggle. </p>	
			<p>Different from the Lived Experiences Project, what we were given for this project was only the template. And by the end of the class, I still didn't figure out how to use the template connects with Github.</p>
				
			<h2>Blog Entry #7</h2>
			<p>Last week with the deadline of Cultural Analysis Project, we were introduced to our new project, Formal Research Project. This project was said to be the most similar kind of paper that we'll be assigned to in college. Unlike the previous ones, this paper
required us to do many researches based on the variety of how information could be present and analyze. Instead of our opinion and personal experience, this project allowed us to read through and analyze both a scholarly and a trade publication article, and interview someone who does research in the discipline. Unlike before, I somehow had a bad feeling towards this project and found it difficult to be accomplished. 
</p>
			<p>We were also introduced to Codecademy, a website allow us to learn the basics of Html sources. I began to work on it after the class and it seems like it's a tool that could help us explore Guthub more deeply. Although I have never learned about this before, but I found it to be interesting and useful for our webpage design. However, I still couldn't figure out how the template could be used for my Cultural Analysis Project. I think I might go to Dr. Daniel's office hour to seek for help.</p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #8</h2>
			<p>This week our draft for the Formal Research Paper is due at midnight. I still felt so bad for this project because I didn't understand a single word of the instructions and didn't know what to do at all. I didn't know what to research about and had no idea for what I'm going to write about. This is my first research paper and the word limit of 3000 words put me in frustration and panic. Therefore, to deal with these dilemmas, I went to Writing Center before this week to seek for help for my first time in college. People at Writing Center was so nice. They lead me through the instructions of this paper, motivated and inspired me with ideas, and discussed with me about what they think this paper is looking for. I spent almost a whole hour there and they still explained and answered my questions with patience. I really appreciated the efforts that people at the Writing Center put into for me. After I brainstormed the outlines for this project, I suddenly felt like I might can succeed on this. </p>
			<p>Another thing that happened in this week was the release of my Cultural Analysis Project grade. It was 10% lower than my Lived Experiences Project, and I was really shocked when I saw the 2.0 beside it. I realized that it must have something to do with the web version which I didn't submit at the due date. I was so regret for not doing that. I could've get a 3.5!</p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #9</h2>
			<p>This week we didn't have class because of Spring Break! However, one of the reasons that I couldn't play hard during the breaks is because of the Formal Research Project. This paper takes much longer than I expected to be complete. We have to go through many long articles and interview people who do research in that discipline. I started to feel stressed when I'm writing this paper. Sometimes I get lost in my own words and didn't know what I was writing. Sometimes I have no thoughts about what to write next even though I've already outlined them. And sometimes I just stared at my computer without thinking anything. I thought it would go well, but it didn't seem like that. I think I might take some rest and go to the Writing Center again. </p>
			<p>However, even I lost interest in doing my Formal Research Paper, I actually found that exploring Github by using the skills I learned at Codecademy turned out to be exciting. I never knew that different HEX codes have so much impact for changing the color of words and I'm even capable of changing the background and the font by myself! If the CSE is as much fun as the Codecademy, I think I might take it next year even it's not required in my major.</p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #10</h2>
			<p>This week, I'm finally done with the Formal Research Project and get rid of the researching. We were introduced to the Remix Proposal which I consider to be the most interesting and appealing one compared to those I've done for this class. By doing this project, we were assigned into groups and were asked to turn one of our previous projects into a different form of presentation. This was our first group-work project, and also the first time that I talked to other people who I didn't know in class. 
I'm not the kind of person who could just talk to someone like we've known each other for years. Especially when I have to use my second language to have conversations with others. I see this project as a chance for me to expand my social circle and get to know more people. I hope our group could work out well and have as much communication if needed so that we could create the most effective and impressive video.
</p>
			<p>However, only three people of my group showed up in the class. Although we tried to discuss what to do, we all didn't have the perfect idea. Therefore, we exchanged our contact information and decided to meet next time. I was actually excited to do this project because we don't have to write papers anymore but to film a video. At least it's much easier. </p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #11</h2>
			<p>Before this week, our group had already came up with a proposal suggested by Dong, the one who was absent last time. Our group decided to use Psy's popular song, Gangnam Style, as the social artifact to illustrate the common problem that exists in Western culture, the stereotypes that exist towards Asian culture. We wanted to create a video that could be entertaining but also educational at the same time. By holding onto this idea, we were struggling about how to make the video demonstrates the idea that we're trying to convey in an effective way at the very beginning. However, through discussion and communication, we came with the resolution which is interviewing people, that of Asian Culture and Western Culture with their reactions towards the video we're going to show them.</p>
			<p>I was quite surprised by the efficiency of our group since I can tell other groups were still discussing about what to do. I'm looking forward to the final video and I believe it will be a good one!</p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #12</h2>
			<p>For this week's class, we continued to work on our group project. During last week's in-class discussion, we were worrying about not being able to finish this project on time. Therefore, by having such a concern, our group met on last Saturday and planned to finish most of the editing. Due to the fact that Shelby couldn't make it, me and the other two members filmed ourselves for the opening and edit our parts of interviews. On the other hand, we asked Shelby to film the conclusion on her own. </p>
			<p>I think the interaction of our group works out pretty well. We all have assigned tasks that needed to be complete before certain dates, and we all could communicate in a fairly way which everyone could share their ideas and no one would be judging.
Every steps that we decided to take are all well-planned. And as a group member, I think I've done my responsibility as well. 
</p>
			<p>Even though working in a group could be hard at times, but our group turned out to be a successful team based on negotiation and communication. It is definitely fruitful and an honor to be working in such a group. </p>
	
			<h2>Blog Entry #13</h2>
			<p>This week is the due week for our Remix Project. For the past few days, we've all been working on the edition of our video. I think one thing that our group differs from others is that we worked on our video individually. When I say individually, we all have a edition of our video which is different from anyone else in our group. The reason why we were doing this was we wanted to have the best version of it. However, if we had more time, I might take more time to cut the scenes to make it runs more fluently, add subtitles to make our audience gain better understanding of what we're saying, and maybe talk more with our interviewees to value their culture like we value ours.</p>
			<p>By doing this project and review our past works, we get to realize what could be improved in order to turn this documentary into an effective and impressive one. 
By utilizing the display of music, pictures and videos, it not only enhanced the purpose and the message that our previous projects tried to convey but also created a different vision for our audience. I not only develop my skills as a writer again but also gained a better understanding of how to cooperate and communicate within an organization.
</p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #14</h2>
			<p>The last project that we've been assigned to was the Retrospective Proposal. Throughout the semester, we've been using narration, reflection, researching, and transformation to meet the requirements of the projects we've been assigned to. And for this one, we analyze and review our past works which is similar to the Remix Project that we did. However, the purpose for this project is no longer to multimedia our projects but to help incoming students to understand the big picture of First-Year Writing to enhance their chances of success in the Program. In addition, there was a second part for this project which is to discuss a certain work we'd done in the past and write the reflection of it in a group. Once again, our group turned out to be finishing the task real quick since everyone offered ideas in order to make it meet the requirements. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, since it is already the week before finals, I have to start finishing up my Codecademy. Although it has been a while since the last time I opened its website, but it still turned out to be useful whenever I have problems dealing with my webpage or the HTML. If I didn't take this class, I wouldn't get to know the existence of the website and thus have a online tool to learn from. 
</p>
			<h2>Blog Entry #15</h2>
			<p>This is our final week for the Spring Term, and for closing up, we need to customize our webpage. For example, the font, colors of words, or even the format. It was really fun for me to look up the HEX codes for colors online and get to choose what color fits the most together on my website. I actually spent a lot of time on the designing of my webpage and I really like it.</p>
			<p>Overall, although writing class is truly a subject which you have to put a lot of efforts in and pay attention to the content that you're writing; but once you are done with it, you would be amazed about how different writing skills could help you to develop and elaborate on your papers. Moreover, taking WRA 110 not only helped us to grow as a writer but also teach us in an non-academics way such as using the HTML to build our webpage and collaborate with others in order to create an effective video. All the assignments were beneficial for us to reach a higher level of success in our life. </p>
