			<h2>Blog Entry #1 (In-Class Activity #1)</h2>
			<p>After watching the video that Dr. Daniels showed us today in class, I believe the purpose and the message that this video is trying to convey is to tell people how different opinions could change one’s life. In the video, the author tells us about his uncle’s story, a homosexual who eventually committed suicide because he was rejected by the society and even his own family. </p>
			<p>By narrating the story in a deep sorrow and with grieved, the author tells us that he himself is facing the same situation like his uncle. However, instead of choosing to run away from the society, the author decides to stay and face the public opinion. By telling both his own story and his uncle’s, the author illustrates the idea that how different thoughts could be applied into the same circumstance. This also helps the video to achieve its purpose since it not only exemplifies both a negative and a positive example but also contrasts the tragic story of his uncle’s to his belief that things will get better.</p>
			<p>The structure of the message starts with showing the letter that he wrote to his uncle, he then recited the letter later on. By using this structure, the author shows how he hated but also gratified that his uncle left him so that he didn’t have to take those judgments anymore. Furthermore, it also shows the impacts that his uncle had bring to him. The structure of this video turned out to be useful for us since it shows us an effective way of narrating a personal experience which we could apply into our Lived Experiences Project. </p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #2 (In-Class Activity #2)</h2>

			</main> This video is targeting at those teenagers who focus on playing games so hard but make no love and have no lives. By using the example of World of Warcraft in the South Park animation, it illustrates the dilemma that teenagers think they are socializing by being in the team online chat but not actually going out and exploring the world themselves. In the game, whenever the griefer shows up, he kills everyone he meets. The griefer is depicted as a silent and obese adult, who have been playing the game nearly every hour of every day ever since the game is released, once again, someone who has no lives at all. <p></p>
Throughout the video, the boys were trying so hard to beat the griefer. They phoned the World of Warcraft support line at Blizzard Entertainment to complain about the situation, gathered all the male classmates to log in at the same time to get the griefer down but eventually failed by everyone being killed, and lastly, by listening to Cartman's suggestion, they played the game 21 hours a day to kill low-level boars to gain experiences to reach a higher level in order to attack the griefer. Although they succeeded at the end, the boys turned out to be lazy, long-haired, overweight and acne-ridden in the process.<p></p>
In my opinion, the video's creators are trying to reflect the current social issue we're facing in our real life. This is what exactly happens in our society right now. Teenagers abandon their studies and pay more attention on video games. To complete a quest or to kill someone becomes their main objective, and even when they accomplish that goal, like what Cartman says in the video, they continue to play in the same way. To be in touch with video games make the teenagers ignore the importance of their life. Their understanding of playing games had been distorted that it became "something that matters" and even took place of exercising. The video's creators are trying to change the fact of this situation and it is also what I strongly believe in.<p></p>

			<h2>Blog Entry #4</h2>
			<p>Today is our first day of class and we were introduced to the course WRA 110. To be honest, taking a writing course in my freshman year as an international student is somewhat challenging. However, I understand that in nowadays society, having the skill to read or write a good essay is essential if we want to success in upper level of education. Besides the course itself and our first assignment, we were also introduced to the website Github which we would be using it for submitting our web version of our projects. I was first very confused when Dr. Daniels taught us about how to create a template. Due to the fact that I was never in touch with computer science or the basics of HTML, it turned out to be tough and harsh for me to explore the website. I was also quite surprised by the fact that we have to know how to create a webpage on our own in a writing class. However, since it's a requirement for our assignments, we still have to figure it out or otherwise we would be taking points off for the paper we write.</p>
			<p>It didn't seem to be a difficult class as long as we accomplish what we have to do. I hope everything goes well and I can learn how to manage Github as soon as possible.</p>
			
			<h2>Blog Entry #5</h2>
			<p> This week we have to finish our Lived Experiences Project and submit a web version of it. To be honest, I had been dealing with my other course's homework so I wasn't on the track to work on my paper for the past few days. However, due to the horrible weather condition, Dr. Daniels was sick again and our class was cancelled. This actually benefits me because somehow I always couldn't pay attention in class to work on my papers, therefore, staying in the dorm would always be my first choice if I could since it would brings up my work efficiency. This project wasn't too hard for me since it only asked us to write about our personal experiences with an anecdote to connect to the pursuing of my current major.</p>
			<p>However, due to the fact that I always use pictures or videos instead of writing my thoughts and experience down, I realized how hard it is to put my personal experience in words especially in descriptive details. Nevertheless, by organizing my visions and goals for my future path, I get to recall my memories of the initial motivation which inspired me to choose this major. This project not only allowed us to develop our writing skills from a first person’s point of view, but also taught us how to convey information to our audience in a informal yet informative way. I actually enjoyed doing this project and it serves as a straightforward start to the course.</p>
