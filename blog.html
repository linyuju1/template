		</main> This video is targeting at those teenagers who focus on playing games so hard but make no love and have no lives. By using the example of World of Warcraft in the South Park animation, it illustrates the dilemma that teenagers think they are socializing by being in the team online chat but not actually going out and exploring the world themselves. In the game, whenever the griefer shows up, he kills everyone he meet. The griefer is depicted as a silent and obese adult, who have been playing the game nearly every hour of every day ever since the game is released, once again, someone who has no lives at all. <p></p>
Throughout the video, the boys were trying so hard to beat the griefer. They phoned the World of Warcraft support line at Blizzard Entertainment to complain about the situation, gathered all the male classmates to log in at the same time to get the griefer down but eventually failed by everyone being killed, and lastly, by listening to Cartman's suggestion, they played the game 21 hours a day to kill low-level boars to gain experiences to reach a higher level in order to attack the griefer. Although they succeeded at the end, the boys turned out to be lazy, long-haired, overweight and acne-ridden in the process.<p></p>
In my opinion, the video's creators are trying to reflect the current social issue we're facing in our real life. This is what exactly happens in our society right now. Teenagers abandon their studies and pay more attention on video games, to complete a quest or to kill someone becomes their main objective, and even when they accomplish that goal, like what Cartman says in the video, they continue to play in the same way. To be in touch with video games make the teenagers ignore the importance of their life. Their understanding of playing games had been distorted that it became "something that matters" and it even took place of exercising. The video's creators are trying to change the fact of this situation and it is also what I strongly believe in.<p></p>
