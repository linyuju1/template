			<h1>Blog Entry #1 (In-Class Activity #1)</h1>
			<p>After watching the video that Dr. Daniels showed us today in class, I believe the purpose and the message that this video is trying to convey is to tell people how different opinions could change one’s life. In the video, the author tells us about his uncle’s story, a homosexual who eventually committed suicide because he was rejected by the society and even his own family. </p>
			<p>By narrating the story in a deep sorrow and with grieved, the author tells us that he himself is facing the same situation like his uncle. However, instead of choosing to run away from the society, the author decides to stay and face the public opinion. By telling both his own story and his uncle’s, the author illustrates the idea that how different thoughts could be applied into the same circumstance. This also helps the video to achieve its purpose since it not only exemplifies both a negative and a positive example but also contrasts the tragic story of his uncle’s to his belief that things will get better.</p>
			<p>The structure of the message starts with showing the letter that he wrote to his uncle, he then recited the letter later on. By using this structure, the author shows how he hated but also gratified that his uncle left him so that he didn’t have to take those judgments anymore. Furthermore, it also shows the impacts that his uncle had bring to him. The structure of this video turned out to be useful for us since it shows us an effective way of narrating a personal experience which we could apply into our Lived Experiences Project. </p>
			
			<h1>Blog Entry #2 (In-Class Activity #2)</h1>

			</main> This video is targeting at those teenagers who focus on playing games so hard but make no love and have no lives. By using the example of World of Warcraft in the South Park animation, it illustrates the dilemma that teenagers think they are socializing by being in the team online chat but not actually going out and exploring the world themselves. In the game, whenever the griefer shows up, he kills everyone he meets. The griefer is depicted as a silent and obese adult, who have been playing the game nearly every hour of every day ever since the game is released, once again, someone who has no lives at all. <p></p>
Throughout the video, the boys were trying so hard to beat the griefer. They phoned the World of Warcraft support line at Blizzard Entertainment to complain about the situation, gathered all the male classmates to log in at the same time to get the griefer down but eventually failed by everyone being killed, and lastly, by listening to Cartman's suggestion, they played the game 21 hours a day to kill low-level boars to gain experiences to reach a higher level in order to attack the griefer. Although they succeeded at the end, the boys turned out to be lazy, long-haired, overweight and acne-ridden in the process.<p></p>
In my opinion, the video's creators are trying to reflect the current social issue we're facing in our real life. This is what exactly happens in our society right now. Teenagers abandon their studies and pay more attention on video games. To complete a quest or to kill someone becomes their main objective, and even when they accomplish that goal, like what Cartman says in the video, they continue to play in the same way. To be in touch with video games make the teenagers ignore the importance of their life. Their understanding of playing games had been distorted that it became "something that matters" and even took place of exercising. The video's creators are trying to change the fact of this situation and it is also what I strongly believe in.<p></p>


			<h1>Blog Entry #3</h1>
			<p></p>
			</main> <p>This week we have to turn in our first assignment for this semester, which is the Lived Experiences Project. In this project, along with analyzing a piece of technology that led us to our chosen career path linked with an anecdote; we moreover gave a brief introduction about our chosen major to whom might not be familiar with. I actually enjoyed writing this paper since it doesn’t require us to do any researches but allows us to write in an informal way. Since we only have to write about our personal experiences, it makes me recall the memories of the anecdote and the initial motivation which inspired me to choose the major I’m studying, communication.</p>
			<p>By doing this project, I not only gained more knowledge and understanding about my major, but also developed my writing skill as a writer. As I mentioned, all this paper is asking for is our own experiences, therefore, narrating our stories in a detailed way became the objective of this paper. When I was done with the final draft, even me myself was overwhelmed by the descriptive structure and the expressive emotions. Writing this paper was certainly a special experience for me since it had been a while for me to describe my story in words instead of photos or videos. I really enjoyed doing this project, and I think it's beneficial to all of us since it serves as a straightforward start to the course.</p>
