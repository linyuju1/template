			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Therefore, by knowing the fact that it is too late to get back off from this technology, one solution that I propose is that by advertising the advantages of what Smartphones can bring us, we also make practical commercials to warn people how Smartphones could change our lives in the meanwhile as well. Like those advertisements on the cigarette boxes , we show realistic pictures and real-life data when we're selling out Smartphones. We're not saying not to use them, but we're suggesting to use them properly. Furthermore, it is important that we make stricter guidelines for the usage of our phones especially for those developing children. An analysis on the Digital Media Test Kitchen states that more than half of college students are early adopters of Smartphones. (n.p. "The Digital Media Test Kitchen") In other words, it means that those harms and damages might be done to those children in their early lives. Although students might not necessarily think it's problematic, but facing the situation that it had even turned out to be an automatic behavior on the part of so many people right now, we have to try our best to control, but not ban, the usage of Smartphones.</p>
