		<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
		<p>To be honest, taking a writing course in my freshman year as an international student is somewhat challenging. Since I'm not a native speaker of English, dealing with grammar and the choice of vocabularies are all something that would put me in struggle. However, in nowadays society, having the ability to read or write a paper is fundamental if we want to achieve a higher level of education in order to success in our life. Throughout the semester, writing those papers certainly helped me to not only develop my writing skills as a writer in the academics ways but also teach me lessons in the non-academics ways.</p>
		<p>The first assignment that we've been assigned to is the Lived Experiences Project. In this project, along with analyzing a piece of technology that led us to our chosen career path linked with an anecdote; we moreover gave a brief introduction about our chosen major to whom might not be familiar with. Even though the minimum number of words required for this paper was the least among all the projects we've done in this semester, but regarding to our personal experiences, it turned out to be a relatively large amount. Back in our high school, we were used to be given a certain topic to write about and did research based on the given information; however, narrating our stories in a detailed way became the objective of this paper, and being descriptive and expressive are what make this paper into an attractive one. Like I mentioned before, although this paper was said to be the least formal and the easiest to write about, but since our goal was to make the essay narrative instead of informal, it did require efforts which we have to rack our brains and avoid being repetitive. Due to the fact that I always use pictures or videos instead of writing them down if I have to record my past moments of life, I realized how hard it is to put my personal experience in words especially in descriptive details. In addition, by organizing my visions and goals for my future path, I get to recall my memories of the initial motivation which inspired me to choose this major. This project not only allowed us to develop our writing skills from a first personâ€™s point of view, but also taught us how to convey information to our audience in a informal yet informative way. I really enjoyed doing this project, and I think it's beneficial to all of us since it serves as a straightforward start to the course. </p>
		<p>Followed by the Lived Experiences Project, the next paper we've been introduced to is the Cultural Analysis Project. By doing this project, we needed to investigate a specific 
social issue and its import on society through the analysis of a cultural artifact, whether it could be a video game, movie, TV show, etc. By giving background information and providing analysis of the artifact, it let us think about its significance and the message it tries to convey, which we might have never think of before. Furthermore, when we explained how that artifact illustrates or depicts our social issue, the artifact itself serves not only as a connection but also as an argument which supports our main point that the social issue we addressed need to be fixed. Although it wasn't asking about our personal experience since we had to do little research about both the artifact and the social issue, I still consider it to be an easy paper; due to the fact that we can still use our imagination and creativity to further propose a solution for the problem and the anticipated results. Besides being able to develop and analyze the social issue at hand, another thing that I learned by doing this project is to create a webpage for the paper I wrote. By utilizing GitHub, we were using the fundamental HTML sources in order to create and customize our webpage. Different from the Lived Experiences Project, what we were given for this project was only the template. And it turned out to be quite tough for someone like me who have never encountered computer science before. This is what I didn't expect when I enrolled in a writing class; however, thanks to Dr. Daniels' help, now I'm capable of using the basics of encoding to build my own webpage. 
</p>
		<p>Next was the Formal Research Project, which was the most similar to the other papers that we'll be assigned to in college. Like it stated in the topic, it was a formal paper required us to do many researches based on the variety of how information could be present and analyze. Besides research, this project also allowed us to read through and analyze both a scholarly and a trade publication article, and interview someone who does research in the discipline. This paper was different than the other two that we've been introduced to since what it need was research reports instead of personal opinion. This turned out to be a difficult task for me not only because of its word limit but also due to the fact that it was my first research paper. Therefore, to deal with these dilemmas, I went to Writing Center to seek for help for my first time in college. I was frustrated and in a panic because I felt like I didn't understand a single word of the instructions and didn't know what to do at all. However, I really appreciated the efforts that people at the Writing Center put in to explain to me what this paper was looking for. Moreover, like I mentioned, in order to write a project like this, we needed to go through many articles to find out the most suitable one to be used in our essay. And another thing that I learned by doing this project was to summarize a long article and sum up the main takeaways. Although this paper did require much more efforts that the previous ones, and the process was truly tough and harsh, but the satisfaction that it brought to me when I finished the paper was the biggest among others. I believe with this time's experience, I can do better without struggling when I face the same task again.</p>
		<p>After doing all those narration and researches, we were introduced to the Remix Proposal which I consider to be the most interesting and appealing one throughout this course. By doing this project, we were assigned into groups and were asked to turn one of our previous projects into a different form of presentation. This was our first group-work project, and also the first time that I talked to other people who I didn't know in class. Although we didn't have a successful start since we couldn't decide what we were going to do, but everything went great after we figured out the outlines for this project. For our group, we chose to use the cultural analysis proposal to advocate a position on a particular social issue, which was the stereotypes that people have towards Asian culture. And by reviewing our past works, we get to realize what could be improved in order to turn this documentary into an effective and impressive one. Through discussion and communication, we came with the contents, structure, and the style of our video. And by utilizing the display of music, pictures and videos, it not only enhanced the purpose and the message that our previous projects tried to convey but also created a different vision for our audience. Although working in a group could be hard at times, but through this project I believe we all gained a better understanding of how to cooperate and communicate within an organization.</p>
		<p>Lastly, the Retrospective Proposal, which is the paper I'm writing now, is our last project for the writing class. This semester we've been using narration, reflection, researching, and transformation to meet the requirements of the projects we've been assigned to. And for this one, we analyze and review our past works which is similar to the Remix Project that we did. However, the purpose for this project is no longer to multimedia our projects but to help incoming students to understand the big picture of First-Year Writing to enhance their chances of success in the Program.</p>
		<p>Overall, although writing class is truly a subject which you have to put a lot of efforts in and pay attention to the content that you're writing; but once you are done with it, you would be amazed about how different writing skills could help you to develop and elaborate on your papers. Moreover, taking WRA 110 not only helped us to grow as a writer but also teach us in an non-academics way such as using the HTML to build our webpage and collaborate with others in order to create an effective video. All the assignments were beneficial for us to reach a higher level of success in our life. </p>
