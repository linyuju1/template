			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>By understanding that it is impossible to get rid of the technology that we've already relied on for so many years, I hope that at least the commercials would affect people to get rid of their addiction to cell phones just like cigarettes. While accepting the convenience that it has bring to our lives, we can still get our balance of life back on its track. Before the occurrence of Smartphones, we were asking what we can do with the phones, but right now, we are asking what we cannot do with the phones. People become lazy since we can do everything on our phones. We may be free to work from anywhere, but we are also prone to be lonely everywhere, says Sherry Turkle. (Sherry Turkle, "Alone Together") When technology comes into our lives, it promises to let us do anything from anywhere with anyone. But it never mentioned that it will also drain us as we try to do everything everywhere. This social issue is widespread, even my myself couldn't run away from this dilemma. However, it is definitely time for us to reconsider, think about since when we feel that we are respectful enough by scrolling our Facebook page during funerals or playing candy crush when we're having Thanksgiving dinner with our family?</p>
