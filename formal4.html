			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>As such, the internet is a medium of communication that plays a crucial role in terms of its contribution to the globalization of the media. As a form of technology that advances on a daily basis, web browsers and social media websites, for instance, are being upgraded all the time, therefore allowing internet users to constantly be able to do something or access something via the internet that they were not previously able to. In comparison to the more traditional mediums, such as printed newspapers, there is little scope for advancement, with only the design or type of information included within the publication that could be changed. Traditional media forms also take time to change, adapt and upgrade, whereas with the internet this can happen immediately.</p>
		  <p>By providing this platform, the internet is allowing media to become global, which is particularly useful for advertisers. By advertising using the internet, advertisers are given the chance to reach a different kind of audience than would be possible through more traditional media forms. For example, while an online fashion retailer could place an advertisement in a newspaper, reaching people on either a local or national level, their audience is still deemed to be limited somewhat, especially when compared to the audience that could potentially be reached through an online fashion retailers’ advertisement on Facebook, for example. Advertising through this media form makes reaching a global audience easy, due to the millions of people all over the world who are signed up to the site. This is simply something that the more traditional media forms cannot compete with, not only because they cannot reach the amount of people that the internet can, but also because it would cost them considerably more to do so.</p>
		  <p>A 2001 study on media coverage and usage indicates that attending movies and watching television were the two media-related activities that consumed most of the time among individuals in the civilian, non-institutional population, as indicated in Figure 2 below. The average times per day were 3.5 and 2.4 hours respectively. On a typical day, an average of 78% of the population watched television, with an average of a meager 1% of the populace attending a movie. Radio took 1.2% of the population 2% of the population, the portion preferring the radio as the primary source of media-related information. Conversely, the 20% of the populace that preferred to engage in reading activities spent in an average 1.5 hours doing so on a daily basis. These estimates, however, only pertain to primary activities.</p>
		  <p>In terms of the relationship between traditional media forms and new media, such as printed publications versus the internet, the relationship is one that could be described as being ‘complementary’. A study looked into whether old media forms were being driven out by newer forms, such as the internet driving out publications. However, findings showed that although the internet is a preferred medium to read the news because of its ability to tell news immediately, people still prefer to back up what they have read online by reading the same story in a printed publication (Western 26). The study stated that ‘at the very least, within the provision of news and information, instead of driving out old media the internet will complement them in serving the seemingly insatiable news and information needs among a substantial segment of society’ (Western 28).</p>
		  <p>However, to provide a contrasting view, the internet has been described as ‘a form of media that has grown in a way that is distinctly different from any other medium’ (We Media 14),and as a result, it is difficult to predict how much of an impact the internet is likely to have in 20 years’ time, as there is no other medium to compare it to (We Media, 2003). With the possibilities of the internet surprising us on a daily basis, making new things possible for users all the time, it is almost impossible to predict the role it will play in the future, or to predict the role tradition media will play, if at all.</p>
